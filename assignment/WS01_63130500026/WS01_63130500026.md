# Workshop 01 EDA: SAT Scores dataset

Dataset from [SAT_original.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/SAT_original.csv)

**Created by Chotiwit Souyan (ID: 63130500026)**

### My Step

1. Define a question.
2. Loading Library and dataset.
3. Find a obserevation and variables.
4. Check duplicated items and list if have.
5. Count a data that are all different.
6. Find min, max, average and quartile of each part.
7. Find min, max, average and quartile of total score.
8. Find a school that has the highest SAT score.

## Step 1 : Define a question

1. How many observation of this dataset (before cleaning) ?
2. Are there duplicate data sets ? (If have duplicate data, list the data that duplicate)
3. How many distinct school in this dataset ? (Know after drop duplicate data)
4. What is min, max, average, quartile of each part in SAT ?
5. What is min, max, average, quartile of total score in SAT ?
6. Which school is get highest SAT score ?

Can add more question ....

## Step 2 : Loading library and dataset

In this workshop we need to use dplyr , stringr , readr and assertive and a assigned dataset.

### 2.1 Import library
```
# Library
library(dplyr)
library(assertive)
library(readr)
library(stringr)
```

### 2.2 Import dataset
```
# Dataset
data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/SAT_original.csv")

# Change type of math_score to numberic and scope it into the range of SAT Score (between 200 and 700)
data$math_score <- data$math_score %>% as.numeric()

# Change type of reading_score to numberic
data$reading_score <- data$reading_score %>% as.numeric()

# Change type of writing_score to numberic
data$writing_score <- data$writing_score %>% as.numeric()
```

## Step 3  : Find a obserevation and variables.

Use glimpse to check row and column.
Row = Observation
Column = Variable
```
data %>% glimpse()
```

Result:
```
Rows: 485
Columns: 5
$ DBN           <chr> "01M292", "01M448", "01M450", "01M458", "01M509", "01M515", "01M539", "01M650",…
$ school_name   <chr> "HENRY STREET SCHOOL FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDIES", "UNIVERSITY NEIGHBORHOOD HIGH …
$ math_score    <chr> "404", "423", "402", "401", "433", "557", "574", "418", "604", "400", "393", "3…
$ reading_score <chr> "355", "383", "377", "414", "390", "332", "522", "417", "624", "395", "409", "3…
$ writing_score <chr> "363", "366", "370", "359", "384", "316", "525", "411", "628", "387", "392", "3…
```
There are 485 rows and 5 column ,
so there are 485 observations and 5 variables.

## Step 4 :  Check duplicated items and list if have.

### 4.1 Find duplicated

Use duplicated() and then put it into a table to see how many duplicated in this data.
```
data %>% duplicated() %>% table()
```
Result
```
FALSE  TRUE 
  478     7 
```
There are 7 duplicated.

### 4.2 List the duplicated data
Use filter to list only the duplicated data.
```
data %>% filter(duplicated(sat_score))
```
Result
```
# A tibble: 7 × 5
  DBN    school_name                                math_score reading_score writing_score
  <chr>  <chr>                                      <chr>      <chr>         <chr>        
1 02M376 NYC ISCHOOL                                483        473           479

4 27Q400 AUGUST MARTIN HIGH SCHOOL                  371        377           360          
5 30Q502 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY HIGH SCHOOL         434        407           398          
6 31R080 THE MICHAEL J. PETRIDES SCHOOL             488        472           466          
7 79X490 PHOENIX ACADEMY                            370        367           360     
```

## Step 5 : Count a data that are all different.
### 5.1 delete a duplicated items
Use distinct to display a diffrent school and assign to an old parameter to remove the duplicated.
```
data <- data %>% distinct()
```

### 5.2 Count a row
Use glimpse() to find a row of data.
```
data %>% glimpse()
```
Result
```
Rows: 478
Columns: 5
$ DBN           <chr> "01M292", "01M448", "01M450", "01M458", "01M509", "01M515", "01M539", "01M650",…
$ school_name   <chr> "HENRY STREET SCHOOL FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDIES", "UNIVERSITY NEIGHBORHOOD HIGH …
$ math_score    <chr> "404", "423", "402", "401", "433", "557", "574", "418", "604", "400", "393", "3…
$ reading_score <chr> "355", "383", "377", "414", "390", "332", "522", "417", "624", "395", "409", "3…
$ writing_score <chr> "363", "366", "370", "359", "384", "316", "525", "411", "628", "387", "392", "3…
```
There are 478 schools.

## Step 6 : Find min, max, average and quartile of each part.
### 6.1 map data into a scope of SAT score (From 200 to 800)
Use filter() to check if score are in range from 200 to 800 and assign to an old parameter.
```
data <- data %>% filter(.data$math_score >= 200 & .data$math_score <= 800)
data <- data %>% filter(.data$reading_score >= 200 & .data$reading_score <= 800)
data <- data %>% filter(.data$writing_score >= 200 & .data$writing_score <= 800)
```
### 6.2 Find min, max, average and quartile of math score
#### Find max
Use max() to find max score and summarise() to display only one column.
```
data %>% summarise(max_math = max(data$math_score))
```
Result
```
# A tibble: 1 × 1
  max_math
     <dbl>
1      688
```
The highest math score is 688.

#### Find min
Use min() to find min score and summarise() to display only one column.
```
data %>% summarise(min_math = min(data$math_score))
```
Result
```
# A tibble: 1 × 1
  min_math
     <dbl>
1      312
```
The lowest math score is 312.

#### Find average
Use mean() to find average score and summarise() to display only one column.
```
data %>% summarise(avg_math = mean(data$math_score))
```
Result
```
# A tibble: 1 × 1
  avg_math
     <dbl>
1     413.
```
The average amth score is 413.

#### Find quartile
Use quantile() to create a quartile of math score.
```
data$math_score %>% quantile()
```
Result
```
   0%   25%   50%   75%  100% 
312.0 371.5 395.0 437.0 688.0 
```
## Step 7 : Find min, max, average and quartile of total score.
### 7.1 Creat a new column called 'total_score`
Use mutate() to add new colomn into existed data.
```
data <- data %>% mutate(total_score = math_score+reading_score+writing_score)
```

### 7.2 Find min, max, average and quartile of total score
#### Find max
Use max() to find max score and summarise() to display only one column.
```
data %>% summarise(max_score = max(total_score))
```
Result 
```
# A tibble: 1 × 1
  max_score
      <dbl>
1      1969
```
The highest total score is 1969.

#### Find min
Use min() to find min score and summarise() to display only one column.
```
data %>% summarise(min_score = min(total_score))
```
Result
```
# A tibble: 1 × 1
  min_score
      <dbl>
1       887
```
The lowest total score is 887.

#### Find average 
Use mean() to find average score and summarise() to display only one column.
```
data %>% summarise(avg_score = mean(total_score))
```
Result
```
# A tibble: 1 × 1
  avg_score
      <dbl>
1     1207.
```
The average total score is 1207.

#### Find quartile
Use quantile() to create a quartile of total score.
```
data$total_score %>% quantile()
```
Result
```
    0%    25%    50%    75%   100% 
 887.0 1102.0 1170.0 1257.5 1969.0 
```

## Step 8 : Find a school that has the highest SAT score.
Use select() to display only school_name and a score columns, then use arrange() to aranage total score from highest score to lowest score.
```
data %>% select(school_name, total_score) %>% arrange(desc(total_score))
```
Result
```
# A tibble: 423 × 2
   school_name                                                          total_score
   <chr>                                                                      <dbl>
